That\u2019s my celebrity exception list.</p>\n<p>A quick explanation of the \u201ccelebrity exception list\u201d before we get rolling. It\u2019s a free pass from your real-life romantic partner. Should you ever manage to seal the deal with somebody on your celebrity exception list, then your partner will serve you with a high-five and not divorce papers. Your celebrities need to be alive \u2013 don\u2019t hit on dead people, dude. You typically get five spots on your list.</p>\n<p>If you google up the faces of the people on my celebrity exception list, you might notice I have a preferred \u201ctype\u201d. Brunette, girl-nextdoor, maybe a little bit pixieish in their eyes and smile.</p>\n<p>We tend to chase the same type of person over and over again because they\u2019re the kinds of people that we feel drawn towards. There are a lot of reasons to date somebody you\u2019re drawn toward.

They're both dating outside of their usual type.</p>\n<p>A relationship with somebody outside of your \u201ctype\u201d might take more work because you\u2019re not naturally on the same page as each other, but it means you\u2019re putting work into the relationship, and that\u2019s a good thing.</p>\n<p>For those wondering, I\u2019d go gay for Jon Stewart and/or Stephen Colbert.</p>\n<p>How about you, Sally? Who\u2019s on your list?</p>\n<p class=\"author\">Sally</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only when considering this question that I realise how dusty my celebrity crush list is. The people I think I fancy I\u2019ve fancied for years but I actually haven\u2019t thought about them in years either.</p>\n<p>When I was in school, I had pictures of Johnny Depp, Kieffer Sutherland and the poet John Keats on my homework diary. But Dan says no dead people, so sorry Kieffer.</p>\n<p>Then there were the comedians. When I was 15 I was in love with Rik Mayall from the <em>Young Ones</em>. Really, he is quite handsome when he isn\u2019t screwing up his face like that.</p>\n<p>Then when I was 16 I discovered Suede and their enigmatic frontman Brett Anderson. Coming from a land of jocks (Australia), I didn\u2019t know a guy could actually look like that: pale, pasty, thoughtful, sexual, a little bit feminine. And I\u2019ve had a thing for androgynous guys ever since.</p>\n<p>I still like that sexy, darker-edged rock star look, but you know, that\u2019s just the packaging. Personality goes a long way.</p>\n<p>I love people\u2019s peccadilloes and minor obsessions (note, minor: 4,000-strong action figure collections are not a turn on). I do have a thing for intellectuals and geeks. But most of all I value kindness.</p>\n<p>So what\u2019s important? The present or the presentation?</p>\n<p>Recently, I was hanging out on a New York rooftop with this cute pocket rocket girl called Roxy and her three friends. We\u2019d met at a gothic nightclub called Dorian Grey. It was four in the morning, the others were smoking, and we were watching the sun rise over the skyline. Roxy showed us a tattoo she had on her upper thigh of three letters: fmk. It stands for fuck, marry or kill. She pointed to the three handsome guys who were leaning nonchalantly against the wall like a rock band photo shoot.</p>\n<p>One was a tall, spider-thin sexy rockstar type dressed all in black with a swatch of dark hair; one a straight guy in drag with a sentimental streak, wearing a pink wig and Sailor Moon dress; one a New York hipster dude with glasses and a Disney shirt. Roxy asked me who I would f, m or k \u2013 fuck, marry or kill. My own brain\u2019s answer surprised me. Maybe it will surprise you too. Write in to the Fan Club with your guesses.</p>\n<p>So, which celebrities do I fancy now? Gosh, now I really have to think about it... Hmm... Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Brian Cox science babe extraordinare, David Mitchell the thinking woman\u2019s English muffin, Peter Dinklage, Adrian Brody. There\u2019s a few to start with. Now, let me think about that some more...</p>\n<p>PS I like a man who enjoys sushi. It means he is adventurous, open minded and isn\u2019t afraid of small things.</p>\n"},{"title":"Arrangements","artwork":"http://slimline.localhost:8082/sites/slimline.localhost/files/luv-20131020-arrangements-28.png","edition":"28","id":"29","path":"/arrangements","publication":"<span class=\"date-display-single\" property=\"dc:date\" datatype=\"xsd:dateTime\" content=\"2013-10-21T18:00:00+10:00\">Monday, October 21, 2013 - 18</span>","script":"Claudia: So I don\u2019t normally do blind dates\u2026 unless I\u2019m blind drunk.

Though I accept the hunter-hunted premise, to a degree, if there\u2019s one thing that made me want to throw the book across the room, it was all the stuff about appearance and personality.</p>\n<p>Be demure and sweet, it said. Always look your best. Brush up on conversation topics by reading about current affairs. Yes, ladies, that is the real reason to care about earthquakes in the Third World: it may impress a guy.</p>\n<p>I have a dear friend who is the opposite of a glamour queen. She wears sneakers, jeans and (her words) \u201cdresses like a 10-year-old boy\u201d. Her don\u2019t-give-a-shit attitude makes her super hot and she snagged a lovely don\u2019t-give-a-shit guy. They are now happily wed.</p>\n<p>But worse than appearance is altering your personality. Don\u2019t be a knee-slapping comedian, <em>The Rules</em> say. Well, slap my knee and call me a comedian, because brash, ballsy humour in a woman is, I believe, to many very attractive. It\u2019s jousting wit that really gets me hot. If we are all being the same kind of woman by reading<em> The Rules</em>, we\u2019d all be attracting the same kind of man. And that man is probably a dick.</p>\n<p><em> The Rules</em> offers some useful advice and that is basically the old adage of playing hard to get. Men enjoy the thrill of the chase. Hold back. Don\u2019t be too keen. They like to smell the blood on the breeze, as my male friend put it.</p>\n<p>Hang on. There\u2019s something wrong with this hunter-hunted metaphor. The hunted ends up dead.</p>\n<p>The hunter, once he\u2019s caught his prey, can happily move on to the next thing. And the poor savaged bunny is left bloody and bruised, wondering, \u201cWhat the hell went wrong there?\u201d</p>\n<p>So is it true? Do guys get their fill and lose interest? Are we really just animals? \u201cLe donna e mobile\u201d the song goes. It means \u201cwomen are fickle\u201d. Maybe men are. Biology is a bitch. Listen to my sexist language. Inescapable.</p>\n<p class=\"author\">Dan</p>\n<p>It seems almost laughable that somebody would try to put \u201crules\u201d around finding a long-term romantic partner. <em>Almost</em> laughable.</p>\n<p>Following Sally\u2019s introduction to <em>The Rules</em>, I read the updated <em>The New Rules</em>. It\u2019s a guide for woman on how to catch a man. And if that\u2019s as deeply as we look at the book\u2019s message, then it\u2019s utter rubbish.</p>\n<p><strong>VISUAL CREATURES</strong></p>\n<p>The book opens with a couple of fundamental assumptions which I found offensive. First: that men are wholly visually-driven creatures. Women must look appealing* to men for men to find them attractive. Sure, as a simplistic generalisation that\u2019s accurate enough... but I don\u2019t feel that description is always true. I don\u2019t know that I fit that stereotype.</p>\n<p>* \u201cAppealing\u201d is a relative term. Ladies, if you want to snag a hipster guy, then dress like an alluring hipster. If you want a sports star, dress like a WAG. If you want to catch a millionaire, dunk yourself in spray tan.</p>\n<p><strong>THE FIRST MOVE</strong></p>\n<p>And there\u2019s a lingering gripe about \u201cmen must make the first moves\u201d \u2013 that is: first contact; first text; first phone call; first date; first expression of commitment.</p>\n<p>The book talks about guys being fickle creatures. If we (as stereotypical males) don\u2019t find a woman sufficiently attractive, for whatever reason, then we will lose interest and that will be the end of that. And you, stereotypical women, have no control over that internal decision-making process.</p>\n<p>But if I, a phallocrat of the male species, do find you attractive, then I <em>will</em> make contact and I <em>will</em> call, and I <em>will</em> express commitment. I will come at you like a tiger drenched in Sex Panther cologne. And again, as a simplistic generalisation, that\u2019s accurate enough. A man who makes the first move is guaranteed to be interested \u2013 because he\u2019s interested enough to overcome himself.</p>\n<p><em>The New Rules</em> advises women to leave men to make any and all of these first moves. Their rationalisation is that \u201cmen are fickle\u201d; that we will lose interest; that we will stop calling; and we won\u2019t bother communicating that decision to the scorned woman, which leaves her feeling worthless or unattractive.</p>\n<p>Yet <em>The New Rules</em> say it\u2019s the man\u2019s exclusive responsibility to expose himself to a woman\u2019s whims of choice. Maybe men are fickle, but women can be just as fickle. It\u2019s bloody rude to advocate that women abdicate the emotional risks that come with making the first move. And it reflects badly on women to give out this advice to other women.</p>\n<p>Women, do you really think men see you as so generic, so interchangeable that if we make a failed pass at your affections that we\u2019ll shrug our shoulders and find the next generic woman to woo*?</p>\n<p>No! It takes a toll on us too. Man up \u2013 share the risks with us.</p>\n<p>* Yes, I know there are actually men like this out there. They\u2019ll be the one\u2019s who start chatting you up on a dating site with a line as simple as \u201cHey there\u201d and maybe a dick pic, right? If you\u2019re okay with this guy chasing you, then go right ahead.</p>\n<p><strong> RESPECT </strong></p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t like the seemingly fickle internal decision-making process of men, then I gotta tell ya, Rules girls, I\u2019ve been left dangling by plenty of women who don\u2019t bother to tell me that my romantic interests are not wanted any longer. You know what sucks? Accidentally becoming that guy who doesn\u2019t know when to stop calling.</p>\n<p>Calling / texting to say \u201cno thanks\u201d seems like such simple respect. And yet it\u2019s became apparent through my online dating escapades that it has disappeared from common courtesy.</p>\n<p>Anyway, back to <em>The New Rules</em>. A few times the book casually mentions the aim of the book is to \u201ctrain men to show the respect [women] deserve\u201d.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a tone of resigned acceptance of human follies throughout the book\u2019s many case studies. Women are portrayed as the silly creatures who put themselves in harm\u2019s way by not following The Rules, and men are the nasty brutes who harm girls (until they\u2019re caught by a Rules girl and then it\u2019s all okay).</p>\n<p>\u201cTo train men to show the respect that women deserve.\u201d</p>\n<p>In this one simple line, you\u2019ll find the thesis of <em>The New Rules</em>: To proactively protect women against the common flaws of men under the guise of respect by giving them mental strategies to control their emotional impulses.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re on board with the thesis of <em>The Rules</em>, then everything the authors write makes perfect sense. They are genuinely good rules for keeping one\u2019s own behaviour in check so as to maximise one\u2019s chances of not scaring away a potential life-long mate. As a demonstration of how much I agree with <em>The Rules</em>\u2019 behaviour-control suggestions, I\u2019ve noticed a handful of Rules creeping into my life.</p>\n<p>All of the advice teaching women to protect themselves against the known flaws of the male species, and not getting bitter when you encounter an individual\u2019s flaws. Good advice.</p>\n<p>The advice about letting the guy make the first move? Rubbish. You\u2019re better than letting yourself become some hunter\u2019s bunny. Chase the hunter if he\u2019s what you want, just don\u2019t forget your defenses.</p>\n"},{"title":"Horny Babes","artwork":"http://slimline.localhost:8082/sites/slimline.localhost/files/luv-20130914-horny_babes-23.png","edition":"23","id":"24","path":"/horny-babes","publication":"<span class=\"date-display-single\" property=\"dc:date\" datatype=\"xsd:dateTime\" content=\"2013-09-16T18:00:00+10:00\">Monday, September 16, 2013 - 18</span>","script":"Maynard at home chatting to friend.\r\nMaynard: So Hank at work tells me I need to be more of a ladies man.\r\nFlatmate, playing computer game, unimpressed, disinterested: Yeah, what does that mean?\r\n\r\nMaynard: It means I need more charisma, and charm, and a new tie.\r\n\r\nFlatmate, still playing: Fuck that, just be yourself, man.\r\nMaynard: I guess you\u2019re right.\r\n\r\nMaynard, sitting at his computer: Sigh.

It's an annual reminder to ask about the mental health of your friends, especially the male ones. It's just a \"reminder\" because it's something you should be doing every week. We struggle to talk about this stuff, and we struggle to ask people who are struggling.</p>\n<p>According to stereotype, men are supposed to be insurmountable bastions of strength and reliability in the storms of life. Ask a man who's built stuff, and he'll tell you that strength only comes when you've got the right supports in place. Without support, even the strongest bastion becomes vulnerable and shaky.</p>\n<p>Ideally: talk to a friend. Ask with the intention of listening to what's happening in their life. Doesn't have to be on RU OK Day - in lots of ways, it's better if it's not on that specific day.</p>\n<p>From past experience, RU OK Days tend to bloat into a clumsy version of what it seeks to achieve. This year, I saw people asking their Twitter followers \"Are you guys okay?\". Yeah, that kinda misses the point.</p>\n<p>If you're serious about men's mental health issues, talk to your man (of either gender) of choice. You need to be the one to ask <em>them</em>.</p>\n<p>Two really important tips:</p>\n<ul><li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>Expecting somebody who is low to ask for help sucks balls</strong>\u00a0<br />They're already low, don't expect them to humble themselves further. Quite a few times I've had friends tell me I \"just need to ask for help\". Which is lovely - really and genuinely. Really. Look, you may not agree with this next sentence... you may (and probably do) have the very best of intentions - but asking for help comes with a sense of admitting defeat. Please don't set a hurdle for offering help. I want to cling to some sense of pride in myself. If I'm low, then I'm probably trying desperately to hold onto everything that I've got, and swallowing my pride is asking me to do something extraordinarily brave. This would be the wrong time to expect me to be additionally exceptionally brave. It may not be much, but pride is <em>something</em> to hold onto. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>And if you're not in my life enough to know to ask if I'm low, then I'm probably not going to approach you either</strong>\u00a0<br />If you're too busy to be in my everyday life when things are good, why would I expect you to have the time to deal with my shit too?</span></li>\n</ul><p>If you know somebody like Maynard, then ask them \u2013 this week \u2013 how they\u2019re doing, and take the time to listen.</p>\n"},{"title":"Handsome Hank","artwork":"http://slimline.localhost:8082/sites/slimline.localhost/files/luv-20130822-HandsomeHank-22.png","edition":"22","id":"23","path":"/handsome-hank","publication":"<span class=\"date-display-single\" property=\"dc:date\" datatype=\"xsd:dateTime\" content=\"2013-09-02T18:00:00+10:00\">Monday, September 2, 2013 - 18</span>","script":"In lunchroom.\r\n\r\nHank, putting arm around shoulder: Maynard, take a tip from a pro, you need to be a ladies man.

Especially when they\u2019re found in a book called <em>The Rules</em>.</p>\n<p>I was lying on the couch of my friend\u2019s apartment in New York one night when she tossed me a small beat-up book with a missing cover. The title page said <em>The Rules</em>.</p>\n<p>I had heard of <em>The Rules</em>: old-fashioned techniques for snagging a guy \u2013 for life, not just for Christmas. As a modern feminist, I had rejected <em>The Rules</em>. I used to get fired up about gender differences. Mars? Venus? We\u2019re all from Earth! I\u2019d rant.</p>\n<p>Values and personality are far more important than gender. That\u2019s like looking at the frame and not the picture! Rant. Rant.</p>\n<p>But as I got older I had to admit that some of this gender stuff was true. Affairs, pornography, we see the same things over and over. Cultural or biological, there are definitely patterns to human behaviour.</p>\n<p>I had to admit, guys like the thrill of the chase. And <em>The Rules</em> basically suggest you let him do all of the chasing. Be always just out of his reach and he will be hooked for life.</p>\n<p>Maybe there\u2019s something to it. We\u2019ve conquered our biology in many areas of life, but the mating dance is probably about as biological as you can get.</p>\n<p>My friend\u2019s copy of the book was well-thumbed. All her girlfriends had read it. It even had underlines and highlighter notes in several different colours by several different hands. Several different women had taken these messages to heart.</p>\n<p>So with a potential new romance on the horizon, I decided to give it a go.</p>\n<p>My friend coached me on <em>The Rules</em>. But I got it all wrong. For example, there was some confusion about when I was going to see this guy in a different city. I wanted to make myself available, but I didn\u2019t want to seem too keen.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll leave that text to reply till tomorrow,\u201d I said. <br />\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d my friend coached. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to reply if it\u2019s about times and dates. You have to be polite.\u201d</p>\n<p>So then she grabbed my phone and actually texted my potential Adonis on my behalf. Now everyone has different text diction. It\u2019s a bit like an accent.</p>\n<p>God love my friend, she made some grammatical errors and typos that I would never have made. But it was sort of mortifyingly hilarious at the same time.</p>\n<p>And in the end it was probably the right thing to do. Cleared up the confusion. I wish I had a coach sitting on my shoulder every time I had to send a text. But then when it came to the bedroom I\u2019d probably ask the coach to leave.</p>\n<p>As for the hunter-hunted thing? The jury is still out. I saw two squirrels in the park going through their mating dance, tussling, tumbling and turning over and over each other, and I honestly couldn\u2019t tell which was male and which was female.</p>\n<p>I kind of liked it that way. I think a little push and pull is good, and it\u2019s true that a guy should be doing just a little bit more of the pushing.</p>\n<p>It makes a girl feel wanted. But like most things in life, it\u2019s probably good to learn \u201cthe rules\u201d and then break them as you see fit.</p>\n"},{"title":"Office Help II","artwork":"http://slimline.localhost:8082/sites/slimline.localhost/files/luv-20130801-office_help_ii-20.png","edition":"20","id":"21","path":"/office-help-ii","publication":"<span class=\"date-display-single\" property=\"dc:date\" datatype=\"xsd:dateTime\" content=\"2013-08-19T18:00:00+10:00\">Monday, August 19, 2013 - 18</span>","script":"Panel 1\r\nAt office, different day, different ties.

It\u2019s generally better for your zen to not engage with the hate.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s also recognition that the comments may include a compliment, much like a review in a newspaper, which might boost the confidence of the artist/writer/creative person involved \u2013 which might imperil their sense of crippling self-doubt.

I really enjoy drawing Claudia. She\u2019s so expressive and cranky and drunk.</p>\n<p>Also: I was discussing the finished artwork of this comic with Sally, and (between this one and the next comic), I thought it highlighted a diabolical opportunity for a woman in Claudia\u2019s position.</p>\n<p>Picture this \u2013 a schmexy, whip-smart lady like Claudia. She\u2019s fed up with the hordes of insipid neanderthals who plague her online profile with requests for sex accompanied by a side of commitment-phobia.</p>\n<p>So a code-smart lady (who is not Claudia because she\u2019s not a coder) could create a dating honeypot trap. What\u2019s a honeypot trap? It\u2019s kind of like a venus fly-trap. Lure in the prey with sweet sexy smells, then trap the victim in a murderous inescapable death trap.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s call our code-smart lady Paige (which is coincidentally the name of Claudia\u2019s pal here). Paige writes herself a dating site. She fills it with fake profiles of women who aren\u2019t her, and one true profile of Paige herself. She drops some coin to advertise the site to men. Gullible men swarm to the site and start messaging the \u201cwomen\u201d.</p>\n<p>Paige now has the absolute upper hand. By monitoring what and how often and to who the men send messages, she can weed out the sex pesterers who are broadcasting their horniness and desperation. And she can see when a guy sends just one sweet, personal message to her.</p>\n<p>But wait, won\u2019t guys start to get suspicious because they\u2019re not getting any replies? No. So completely, laughably no. There are so many men on the dating sites that it\u2019s utterly unremarkable to not get a reply... or even one reply in 10. After maybe 10 messages, a guy might shrug his shoulders and try Blendr instead. They\u2019d never notice.</p>\n<p>So I tried to explain that whole concept to Sally and she just shook her head.

Yay or nay? I\u2019ve dabbled in manscaping. I\u2019ve gone as far as defoliating my back a few times. A quick tale of woe...</p>\n<p>Two days before heading to Las Vegas for a holiday, a casual friend was staying over. From previous experience, I know there are two spots on the shoulder blades which are difficult to reach with fingertips \u2013 the resulting hairy patches aren\u2019t sexy. So I plucked up the<br />\ncourage to ask my friend to assist. Bless her heart, she agreeed. Ten minutes later, I\u2019m naked in the shower with caustic foam being rubbed into my back like it\u2019s doggy shampoo. It worked well enough, except for three things:</p>\n<ol><li>The sudden absence of hair does weird things to the regulation of sweat coming out of one\u2019s pores. Hello, excess back sweat on a long-haul flight.</li>\n<li>There is no logical place for defoliation to stop on my body. Back hair rolls into butt hair which rolls into leg hair. Do you stop at the pants line and rock a look reminiscent of He-Man\u2019s furry underpants, or do you wipe your ass clean \u2013 leaving you with a pair of hairy stockings?</li>\n<li>My casual friend never stayed over again.</li>\n</ol><p>The obvious solution to the hairline problem is to keep going and fully shave my legs. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re suddenly talking deforestation on the scale of the Amazon. And for a while \u2013 especially when I\u2019m single and looking* \u2013 that kind of effort is manageable. But sooner or<br />\nlater, a life partner is going to discover that she\u2019s dating a descendant of Sasquatch.</p>\n<p>Long story short, the results of manscaping are great. I\u2019ve got muscle tone these days, and I want to show it off \u2013 but hair gets in the way. On the other hand, the effort to maintain manscaping..? Meh.</p>\n<p>* I support the realisation that a woman is not naturally hairless, and is not obliged to shave legs or armpits or whatever. May I never ask a woman to defoliate. I like the look, but it\u2019s not something that should ever be expected. Do it or don\u2019t do it because you choose to do it for your own personal reasons.</p>\n"},{"title":"On and Off Again","artwork":"http://slimline.localhost:8082/sites/slimline.localhost/files/luv-20130425-off_and_on-01.png","edition":"1","id":"2","path":"/on-and-off-again","publication":"<span class=\"date-display-single\" property=\"dc:date\" datatype=\"xsd:dateTime\" content=\"2012-09-01T18:00:00+10:00\">Saturday, September 1, 2012 - 18</span>","script":"Maynard and Magnum chatting.\r\nMaynard: Look, I don&#039;t get women.

And I guess this is as good a place as any to tell the story of how this all began. It\u2019s actually Sally\u2019s story to tell, but I always find a person\u2019s story is much more interesting when somebody else tells the tale. So I\u2019m hijacking this opportunity.</p>\n<p>We all cope with the end of a relationship differently. Drinks, drugs, strippers, religion, travel, karaoke, shopping and random hookups are all tried and true methods of coping. A friend of a friend is turning her dating woes into a musical. I once turned my online dating<br />\nshenanigans into a Nanowrimo effort. Sal decided to turn her relationship breakdown into laughter as a stand-up comedian. Ask her about it some time. Better yet, go and see her in a show.</p>\n<p>So Sally also started writing short comic strips, some of which became LUV. Others are still percolating. There\u2019s one involving Jesus\u2019 second coming that I can\u2019t wait for Sally to invite me to draw.</p>\n<p>As it happens, also around that time, I was sharing a house with one of Sally\u2019s best friends. She kept trying to hook me up with Sal \u2013 and not in the \u201cyou guys should make a comic together\u201d way. Nothing happened there, but we have now made sweet, sweet LUV.<br /><br />\nCue the bad joke groans.</p>\n<p>Sal has mentioned how she\u2019s always liked comics \u2013 she grew up reading <em>Archie</em>. And a large part of her comedy routine is a defense of nerds and geeks as potential romantic partners. They\u2019re different, not defective. When we create comics about<br />\ngeeks and dating (and music and zombies), we\u2019re not sledging geeks for the sake of being mean. LUV is written with genuine affection for the unconventional gentleman.</p>\n<p>By the way, I haven\u2019t told you the end to Sally\u2019s story. And I certainly won\u2019t be telling you the end of LUV\u2019s story yet. Not for a long time.</p>\n<p class=\"author\">Sally</p>\n<p><em>Off and On Again</em> and <em>Geeks\u2019 Guide to Girls</em> are the first two comics I wrote for LUV. Two riffs on the same theme, they were inspired by the <em>IT Crowd</em> ethos of solving any computer problem by \u201cturning it off and turning it on again\u201d. I lived with a guy who turned things off and on for a living (including me). His business card logo was the classic off-on symbol you see on any computer. I\u2019m not sure if his clients were in on the joke. Sneaky, huh? Did they know that\u2019s what they were really paying him<br />\nfor? Is it plugged in?</p>\n<p>The off-again-on-again theme can easily be applied to relationships. Hell, many relationships are literally off-again-on-again. Push-pull, hot-cold, tears-joy... it\u2019s what keeps us bemused and amused. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with a bit of off-on occasionally. Like any<br />\nsystem, sometimes a relationship can benefit from a good old defrag and reboot.</p>\n"}]}
