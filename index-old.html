    <h1>Notes on Title</h1><!-- Content will get moved into position here by javascript -->
    <p>If you're reading this, then I guess you've come all the way back to the start. And I guess this is as good a place as any to tell the story of how this all began. It's actually Sally's story to tell, but I always find it's much more interesting when somebody else re-tells the story. So I'm hi-jacking this opportunity.</p><p>We all cope with the loss of a relationship(s) differently. Drinks, drugs, strippers, religion, travel, karaoke, shopping, and random hook-ups are all tried and true methods of coping. A friend of a friend is turning her dating woes into a musical. I once turned my online dating shenanigans into a Nanowrimo effort. Sal decided to turn her heartbreak into comedy gold as a stand-up comedian. Ask her about it some time. Better yet, go and see her in a show.</p><p>Anyway, around this time Sally also started writing short comic strips. Some of which became LUV. Others are still percolating. There's one involving Jesus' second coming that I can't wait for Sally to invite me to draw.</p><p>As it happens, also around that time, I was sharing a house with one of Sally's best friends. She kept trying to hook me up with Sal - and not in the \"you guys should make a comic together\" way. Nothing happened there, but we have now made sweet, sweet LUV. Cue the bad joke groans.</p><p>Sal has mentioned a few times how she's always liked comics - she grew up reading <em>Archie</em>. And a large part of her comedy routine is a defense of nerds and geeks as potential romantic partners. They're different, not defective. I'm pretty sure the two of us both agree that when we create comics about geeks and romance (and music and zombies), that we're not sledging on geeks for the sake of being mean. LUV is written with genuine affection for the unconventional gentleman. There's (probably) a lot to like about your friendly neighbourhood nerd, and we hope you find there's a lot to like about LUV Comics.</p><p>By the way, I haven't told you the end to Sally's story. And I certainly won't be telling you the end of LUV's story yet. Not for a long time.</p><p>Sally adds:<br /><em>Off and On Again</em> and <a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3&amp;catid=10&amp;Itemid=185\">Geeks Guide to Girls</a>\u00a0are the first two comics I wrote for LUV. Two riffs on the same theme, they were inspired by the <em>IT Crowd</em> ethos of solving any computer problem by \u201cturning it off and turning it on again\u201d. I lived with a guy who turned things off and on for a living (including me). His business card logo was the classic off-on symbol you see on any computer. I\u2019m not sure if his clients were in on the joke. Sneaky, huh? Did they know that\u2019s what they were really paying him for? Is it plugged in?</p><p>The off-again-on-again theme can easily be applied to relationships. Hell, many relationships are literally off-again-on-again. Push-pull, hot-cold, tears-joy\u2026 it\u2019s what keeps us bemused and amused. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with a bit of off-on occasionally. Like any system, sometimes a relationship can benefit from a good old defrag and reboot.</p>
